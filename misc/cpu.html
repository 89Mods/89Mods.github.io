	<p>
	AvaliArch32 (AA32) is a 32-bit load/store microprocessor architecture. This page will describe its architecture and instruction set.
	</p>
	<h2>1. Memory</h2>
	<p>AA32 has a single word-addressable logical memory space of 2³² <i>words</i>. A <i>word</i> is defined as 16-bits (2 bytes). A <i>dword</i> is defined as 32-bits, and a <i>qword</i> as 64-bits. The memory is circular, and address calculations exceeding the 2³² limit will wrap around to the beginning of the address space.<br>
	This address space may contain main memory, but may also respond to system I/O devices.</p>
	<h2>2. Registers</h2>
	<h4>2.1. Data Registers</h4>
	<p>AA32 defines 64 general-purpose dword-long data registers. Instructions can directly operate on the data stored in these registers, most of which perform a read-modify-write operation.<br>
	As an exception, register r0 is defined as a zero-register, meaning it will always yield the value 0 when read, and writes to it will have no effect, and the written word is discarded. This allows for fast comparisons with 0, and more efficient implementation of data transfer instructions.</p><p>
	Another important register is r1, which is where call instructions will back up the return address, and which holds the address that return instructions will branch to. If a subroutine needs to call further subroutines, a software stack may be used to back up furter return addresses.
	</p><p>
	The architecture also defines 8 predicate registers, each of which holds a boolean value, and may be used as a condition to skip instruction execution. They may be set based on a given condition, such as a CC compare match, or from a register’s Carry Flag. Register p0, similar to r0, also has a fixed value, though in this case, it is always set (True), meaning it is the default predicate to be used for instructions that always execute.</p><p>
	The only other register in the architecture is the program counter, which always points to the next instruction to be executed. It may be set to an explicit value by an instruction, causing program execution to branch. Its value may also be retrieved automatically and written to a memory address just before a branch, enabling subroutine calls.</p>

	<h4>3.2. Status Registers</h4>
	<p>The architecture also defines the concept of a Status Register, accessible through the <code>srr</code>, <code>srw</code> instructions. A 16-bit address is used to index these, and even though this documentation will define a handful of required SRs, the actually registers present on a specific processor may very between implementations (for instance, a microcontroller variant of AA32 may define registers for GPIO).</p>

	<h2>3. Interrupts and traps</h2>
	<p>AA32 has 128 possible interrupts, as encoded in the <code>trap</code> instruction. Upon execution of a trap instruction, the processor will branch to the requested interrupt number, multiplied by 8. Unlike a regular branch, the return address will be backed up in the SR pc'. A <code>iret</code> instruction must be used to restore pc from pc', and return program execution to the previous location. As the system starts up with interrupts disabled, <code>trap 0</code> may be used as a way to trigger a software reset.<br>Interrupts will be automatically disabled by the trap instruction, and can be re-enabled by writing to the <code>ien</code> register.</p><p>Upon reception of an interrupt signal, the current instruction execution is completed, and the <code>IACK</code> signal will be asserted by the hardware. The processor will then read one 7-bit word from the system bus, before injecting a <code>trap</code> instruction in the instruction stream, with the interrupt number set to the 7-bits received on the bus. This allows for 128 vectored system interrupts.</p>
	<h2>4. Instruction set</h2>
	<h4>4.1. Instruction types and encoding</h4>
	<p>AA32 features 5 main types of instructions: Register/register (R), Immediate (I), Predicate-management (P), Memory (M), Branch (B) and Jump (J). Every instruction has a fixed length of 42-bits¹, loaded LSB first in two 32-bit data fetches, truncated to 42-bit. All instructions except M-type will operate only on the CPU registers. Only being able to access main memory through M-type load/store instructions makes AA32 a Load/Store class architecture.</p>
	<p>
	All instructions must begin with an 8-bit opcode, followed by a three bit pointer into the predicate register set. The instruction will only execute if the pointed to predicate is True. If it is not, instruction execution is aborted, and the instruction following the current one is loaded.<br>
	This information is followed by the specific argument required by the instruction type. See the table below for a complete list.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>¹<small>This instruction length was chosen as the most optimal instruction length for the eventual AA32VL architecture, and so used in this predecesor arch.</small></p>

	<h4>4.3. Arithmetic and logic instructions</h4>
	<p>Arithmetic instructions all operate on a pair of values, rs1 and rs2, which are registers by default, and will output a result into register dst.<br><br>Arithmetic instructions in AA32 may have one or both of two modifiers: Immediate (as indicated by a trailing 'I' in the instruction mnemonic), or Accumulating (as inidicated by a leading 'A' in the instruction mnemonic). <br><br>Immediate causes the value of rs2 to instead be replaced by a 16-bit value included with the instruction code. How this 16-bit value is expanded to a 32-bit operand depends on the instruction, and wether the UL bit in the instruction code is set.<br><br>If UL is not set, the immediate value will be interpreted as a 16-bit integer and padded with zeroes. If the instruction used explicitely operates on signed values, it will be sign-extended to a 32-bit signed value. In this mode, the immediate has a value range of 0 - 65535 for unsigned instructions, and -32768 - 32767 for signed instructions.<br><br>If UL is set, the immediate value will simply be zero-extended (shifted left 16 bits) to a 32-bit value. No other modification needs to be done depending on wether a signed or unsigned number is required.<br><br>In the case of the Accumulating modifier, the instruction will not overwrite dst when storing to it, but instead add the output of the instruction to the current value of dst. This does not apply to the SRs <code>mulms</code> or <code>divmso</code>. Since this addition operation may result in a carry, this is stored in the <code>acarr</code> SR. This value is not used by further accumulating instructions, but can be read and handled by software during the processing of multi-word values.<br>Both of these modifiers can exist on the same instruction at once. For instance, <code>amuli</code> will perform an unsigned multiplication between rs1 and an immediate value, and add the result to dst.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">ADD</h4>
	<p>Adds rs1 and rs2, storing the result in dst. The carry of the operation is also saved.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">ADC</h4>

	<h4>4.4. Arithmetic modifiers</h4>
	<h4>4.5. Predicate instructions</h4>
	<p>Predicate instructions are those that are used to set the state of the predicate registers. Of note is that these instructions can themselves be predicated, allowing complex code branches to be simplified through predication.<br>Unlike other instructions in the architecture 'dst' in a predicate instruction is a 3-bit pointer into the predicate register space, instead of a 6-bit pointer into data register space. All predicate instructions do still operate on a pair of rs1 and rs2 registers, however, as most of them perform comparisons. rs1 and rs2 can be set to reference r0 in the case of <code>spc</code>, <code>spnc</code>, <code>spf</code> and <code>spt</code>.<br>All predicate instructions will decide on wether or not to 'set' dst. If it is set, its value becomes True, otherwise it is reset to False.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPC / SPNC</h4>
	<p>Set a predicate based on the carry flag. <code>spc</code> sets if carry = 1, <code>spnc</code> sets if carry = 0.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPE / SPNE</h4>
	<p>Set a predicate based on a comparison of rs1 and rs2. <code>spe</code> sets if rs1 = rs2, <code>spne</code> sets if rs1 ≠ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPL / SPNL</h4>
	<p>Set a predicate based on a comparison of rs1 and rs2. <code>spl</code> sets if rs1 < rs2, <code>spnl</code> sets if rs1 ≥ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPG / SPNG</h4>
	<p>Set a predicate based on a comparison of rs1 and rs2. <code>spg</code> sets if rs1 > rs2, <code>spng</code> sets if rs1 ≤ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPF</h4>
	<p>Always resets the specified predicate to False.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SPT</h4>
	<p>Always sets the specified predicate to True.</p>
	<h4>4.6. Memory instructions</h4>
	<p>Memory instructions are the only type of instruction capable of accessing main memory. They transfer data in and out of the data registers. All of them use a register, rs1, as the base address and also have a dst register as the source or destination for the loaded/stored data. A signed 17-bit immediate value is added onto the base address to obtain the effective address. This means memory within a range of ±64KW relative to the base address can be accessed.<br><br>The accumulating modifier can be applied to the load instructions, allowing loaded values to be directly added onto registers. This is once again indicated in the instruction mnemonic using a leading 'A'.<br><br>16-bit loads or stores may occur at any address, but 32-bit loads or stores must have even addresses. This is enforced by the processor ignoring the 0th bit of the effective address.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">LD</h4>
	<p>Load a 32-bit value from memory into dst.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">LDU</h4>
	<p>Load a unsigned 16-bit value from memory into dst. The value is loaded into the 16 least-significant bits of dst while the most-significant bits of dst are cleared with zeroes.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">LDS</h4>
	<p>Load a signed 16-bit value from memory into dst. The value is sign-extended to 32-bits before being loaded into dst.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">POP</h4>
	<p>Load a 32-bit value from memory into dst. In parallel to this operation, a 1 is added onto the value of rs1, and stored back into rs1, incrementing the register.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">STR</h4>
	<p>Store the 32-bit value of dst into memory.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">STU</h4>
	<p>Store the unsigned 16-bit value of dst into memory. Only the least-significant 16 bits of dst are stored.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">STS</h4>
	<p>Store the signed 16-bit value of dst into memory. dst’s value is reduced to a 16-bit integer, while preserving the sign of the number. Only these 16 bits are stored.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">PUSH</h4>
	<p>Store the 32-bit value of dst into memory. In parallel to this operation, a 1 is substracted from the value of rs1, and stored back into rs1, decrementing the register.</p>
	<h4>4.7. Branch instructions</h4>
	<p>Branch instructions encode a short branch relative to the program counter, which is always dependent on some condition (with the exception of <code>br</code>). The effective address is computed by adding a immediate value onto pc. Since branches must go to a address divisible by 2, the 17-bit signed immediate value encoded in the instruction is automatically multiplied by 2, allowing branches to memory within a range of ±128KW relative to pc. This alignment is enforced by the effective address’ least significant bit being cleared before the branch is taken.<br><br>Every branch instruction will take in two registers, rs1 and rs2, as most of them decide wether to branch depending on a comparison between two registers. rs1 and rs2 can be set to r0 in the case of <code>brc</code>, <code>brnc</code> and <code>br</code>.<br><br>If a branch instruction’s condition fails, it will not affect the value of pc. The instruction will be skipped, the instruction following the branch will be executed.<br><br>All branch instructions will back up the address of the instruction following the branch instruction into register r1. This means that all branch instructions are simulatinously subroutine call instructions. If a subroutine itself contains branches (i.e. for a loop), it only need to copy the value of r1 to a different register.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">BRC / BRNC</h4>
	<p>Branches depending on the state of the carry bit. <code>brc</code> branches if carry = 1, <code>brnc</code> branches if carry = 0.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">BRE / BRNE</h4>
	<p>Branches depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>bre</code> branches if rs1 = rs2, <code>brne</code> branches if rs1 ≠ rs2.</p>

	<p>Branches depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>brl</code> branches if rs1 < rs2, <code>brnl</code> branches if rs1 ≥ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">BRG / BRNG</h4>
	<p>Branches depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>brg</code> branches if rs1 > rs2, <code>brng</code> branches if rs1 ≤ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">BR</h4>
	<p>Branch unconditionally.</p>
	<h4>4.8. Jump instructions</h4>
	<p>There are two instructions in AA32 that are capable of moving program execution to anywhere within the address space.<br>Similar to memory instructions, they determine the effective address of the jump from a base address taken form a register rs1, added with a 17-bit immediate. However, like the branch instructions, the 17-bit immediate is multiplied by 2 automatically, and the alignment is enforced by the effective address’ least significant bit being cleared before the jump is taken.<br>Jumps may also be relative to the program counter, in which case pc is added onto the effective address.<br><br>Jumps cannot be conditional, but just like branch instructions, jumps will also back up the address of the instruction following the jump instruction to r1, with the exception of <code>reti</code>, which does not modify r1. <code>jmp</code> in particular can be used for subroutine returns by specifying r1 as the base address, with an offset of 0.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">JMP</h4>
	<p>Unconditional jump to an absolute address.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">JR</h4>
	<p>Unconditional jump to a pc-relative address.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">IRET</h4>
	<p>Unconditional jump to an absolute address. Ignores the immediate offset and rs1, instead using the value of the SR pc' as the jump target.</p>
	<h4>4.9. Comparison instructions</h4>
	<p>A special set of instructions that runs a comparison between two values, and sets or resets a register depending on the result. Every comparison instruction will take in two registers, rs1 and rs2, and have a destination register dst. The instruction will compare rs1 and rs2, and decide wether or not to 'set' dst. If it decides to set, dst will be loaded with the value 1, otherwise it will be loaded with a value of 0. rs1 and rs2 can be set to r0 for <code>set</code> and <code>clr</code>, which do not require them.<br><br>Except <code>set</code> and </code>clr</code>, all of these instructions can have the immediate modifier, once again indicated in the mnemonic by a trailing 'I', in which case rs2 will be replaced by a 16-bit immediate value in the comparison. Depending on the state of the UL bit, this immediate will either be treated as a 16-bit number (UL = 0), or shifted left by 16 bits into a 32-bit number (UL = 1).</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SE / SNE</h4>
	<p>Sets dst depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>se</code> sets if rs1 = rs2, <code>sne</code> sets if rs1 ≠ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SLT / SNLT</h4>
	<p>Sets dst depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>slt</code> sets if rs1 < rs2, <code>snlt</code> sets if rs1 ≥ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SGT / SNGT</h4>
	<p>Sets dst depending on a comparison between rs1 and rs2. <code>sgt</code> sets if rs1 > rs2, <code>sngt</code> sets if rs1 ≤ rs2.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SET</h4>
	<p>Always sets dst to 1.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">CLR</h4>
	<p>Always clears dst to 0.</p>
	<h4>4.10. Miscelanious instructions</h4>
	<p>Instructions that do not fit into any of the above categories.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">NOP</h4>
	<p>No operation is performed. The instruction is skipped, and the one following it is executed.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SRR</h4>
	<p>Status register read. Formated like an immediate instruction, it will treat the immediate value as a 16-bit index into the SR address space and load from the specified SR into dst. If it is made to point at a nonexistent SR, the value read will be 0. rs1 and UL are ignored.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">SRW</h4>
	<p>Status register write. Formated like an immediate instruction, it will treat the immediate value as a 16-bit index into the SR address space and write the value of dst into the specified SR. If it is made to point at a nonexistant SR, the instruction will have no effect. rs1 and UL are ignored.</p>
	<h4 style="font-family: monospace, monospace;">TRAP</h4>
	<p>Special type of jump. Formated like an immediate instruction, but ignores rs1, UL and dst. Takes the least significant 8 bits of the immediate value, multiplies them 8, and moves program execution to that address. The address of the instruction following the trap instruction will be backed up in pc'.</p>
